# [EF-Core_Dapper_Tutorial](https://codewithmukesh.com/blog/using-entity-framework-core-and-dapper/)

[Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) and [Dapper](https://dapper-tutorial.net/) Tutorial

## BackEnd

Documentation pages made with [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) (with
[Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) dependency to generate the class diagrams)

## Personal notes

### Ideally, the following files should be at the [Persistence](Back/src/EF-CoreDapperTuto.Persistence) layer:

-   [EF-CoreDapperTuto.Domain/Interfaces/IApplicationDbContext](Back/src/EF-CoreDapperTuto.Domain/Interfaces/IApplicationDbContext.cs)
-   [EF-CoreDapperTuto.Domain/Interfaces/IApplicationReadDbConnection](Back/src/EF-CoreDapperTuto.Domain/Interfaces/IApplicationReadDbConnection.cs)
-   [EF-CoreDapperTuto.Domain/Interfaces/IApplicationWriteDbConnection](Back/src/EF-CoreDapperTuto.Domain/Interfaces/IApplicationWriteDbConnection.cs)

### Ideally, the following files should be at the Application layer (that doesn't exist in the tutorial):

-   [EF-CoreDapperTuto.Persistence/DTOs/DepartmentDTO](Back/src/EF-CoreDapperTuto.Persistence/DTOs/DepartmentDTO.cs)
-   [EF-CoreDapperTuto.Persistence/DTOs/EmployeeDTO](Back/src/EF-CoreDapperTuto.Persistence/DTOs/EmployeeDTO.cs)

### The methods that deals with HTTP requests

The file
[EF-CoreDapperTuto.API\Controllers\EmployeeController.cs](Back\src\EF-CoreDapperTuto.API\Controllers\EmployeeController.cs)
contains all the implementation of the sql queries... Ideally, it should be done
on the Persistence layer. Then called by another method on the Application
layer, that would be used by the API layer (the controller).

### Omnisharp

Sometimes it drives me nuts... ðŸ˜œ
